  "info":"Two's Complement is a system to sign numbers, which also makes addition with negative numbers the same as with positive ones (in binary). In practice, this is done by inverting B's input and adding 1 to the calculation (using the CARRY IN).",
  "desc": "A and B each represents a number (1 bit). C is the toggle for subtraction. 1 and 2 represents the sum of A and B (2 bits). Create a full-adder with optional subtraction (A+B and A-B). This is done using Two's Complement on B. See truth table.",
